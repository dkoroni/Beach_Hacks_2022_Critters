# Beach_Hacks_2022_Critters
 Project for BeachHacks 2022

The project asks for user input regarding the critters' max health and viewing distance as well as how much food should be provided. Then the critters search for food within their view. If there is no food spotted, the critter will move in a random direction. Once all food has been depleted, time has run out, or every critter dies, a new generation of critters is spawned inheriting the traits of the 4 most viable critters. There is a small amount of variance with each new generation.
